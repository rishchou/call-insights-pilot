## Technical Implementation

### Session State Variables
```python
demo_screen: str        # Current screen: "welcome", "setup", "processing", "dashboard"
demo_config: dict       # Stores client, agent, and parameter selections
demo_results: dict      # Stores transcription and analysis results
demo_file: UploadedFile # Currently uploaded audio file
```

### API Requirements
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for Whisper transcription
- `CLAUDE_API_KEY` - Required for Claude analysis

Both keys are validated before processing begins.

### Navigation Flow
```
welcome → setup → processing → dashboard
   ↑        ↑                      ↓
   └────────┴──────────────────────┘
