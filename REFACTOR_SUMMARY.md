   - Gemini-based speaker labeling (AGENT/CUSTOMER)
   - Consistent return format with caching

2. **`csv_export.py`** (184 lines)
   - Detailed parameter export (similar to notebook)
   - Summary export for quick overviews
   - Batch export for multiple files
   - Truncation support for large transcripts

3. **`README_REFACTOR.md`** (documentation)
   - Complete setup instructions
   - Usage flow guide
   - Feature descriptions
   - Troubleshooting tips

### Modified Files
1. **`ai_engine.py`**
   - Removed A/B testing logic (OpenAI + Gemini)
   - Now uses only Gemini-2.0-flash-exp
   - Simplified function signatures
   - Streamlined comprehensive analysis

2. **`streamlit_openai_call_insights_app.py`**
   - Added transcription engine dropdown
   - Three tabs: Upload & Process, Analyze Results, Export CSV
   - Analysis depth selection (Quick/Standard/Deep)
   - Custom rubric support
   - Rich results display with coaching opportunities
   - CSV export buttons (summary + detailed)

3. **`requirements.txt`**
   - Removed unused dependencies (anthropic, google-cloud-speech)
   - Added requests for HTTP calls
   - Updated deepgram-sdk and assemblyai versions

## Key Features

### Transcription Engines
- âœ… **Whisper** - OpenAI with translation
- âœ… **Gladia** - Async API with multilingual support
- âœ… **Deepgram** - Nova-2 Phonecall optimized
- âœ… **AssemblyAI** - Auto language detection

All with Gemini speaker labeling!

### Analysis (Gemini-2.0-flash-exp)
- Call triage (purpose, category, sentiment)
- Business outcomes (result, compliance, risks)
- Parameter scoring (0-100 with anchors)
- Overall quality metrics
- Coaching opportunities

### CSV Export
- **Summary**: High-level metrics across all calls
- **Detailed**: Every parameter with evidence and coaching
- Includes full transcripts and context
- Ready for Excel analysis

## Usage

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure secrets (.streamlit/secrets.toml)
OPENAI_API_KEY = "..."
GEMINI_API_KEY = "..."
# Optional: GLADIA_API_KEY, DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY

# 3. Run the app
cd call-insights-pilot
streamlit run streamlit_openai_call_insights_app.py
```

## Workflow

1. Select transcription engine from dropdown
2. Upload audio files (auto-processed)
3. Select files and configure analysis depth
4. Run AI analysis with Gemini
5. View results (triage, outcomes, scores, coaching)
6. Export CSV (summary or detailed parameters)

## What Changed from Original

### Before
- A/B testing with GPT and Gemini
- Only Whisper transcription
- Complex multi-model comparison logic
- No detailed CSV export

### After
- Single Gemini model for analysis
- 4 transcription engine options
- Simplified, focused analysis
- Notebook-style detailed CSV export
- Clear UI with 3 tabs
- Engine selection dropdown

## Alignment with Notebook

The refactored code now matches the notebook workflow:
- âœ… Multiple transcription engines
- âœ… Gemini for analysis (gemini-2.0-flash-exp)
- âœ… Gemini for speaker labeling
- âœ… Detailed parameter CSV export
- âœ… Parameter rows with evidence, coaching, justification
- âœ… Configurable rubrics (Quick/Standard/Deep)
- âœ… Custom rubrics for industries

## Testing Notes

Make sure to test:
1. Each transcription engine separately
2. Analysis with different depths
3. Custom rubric parameters
4. CSV export (both summary and detailed)
5. Multiple file batch processing

## API Keys Needed

Minimum:
- **OPENAI_API_KEY** (for Whisper)
- **GEMINI_API_KEY** (for analysis)

Optional (for other engines):
- GLADIA_API_KEY
- DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
- ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY

## Next Steps

1. Set up `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with API keys
2. Install requirements
3. Run the app and test with sample audio
4. Upload audio, select engine, process
5. Analyze with different depths
6. Export and review CSV outputs

Enjoy your refactored Call Insights tool! ðŸŽ‰
